Concepts
--------

- Change sphinx documentation to use mathjax to render equations
- Added packing fraction to :ref:`Material <Materials>` to separate number density and effective number density.
- Added a feature allowing time-dependent values for individual instrument parameters.
- Added a ``PythonStdOutChannel`` and the ability to change the :ref:`logging channel <Properties File>` without restarting mantid framework

Algorithms
----------

- The calculation of a distance has been updated in Track to correctly calculate the distance for objects that have multiple intercepting surfaces, e.g. hollow cylinder. This affect algorithms such as :ref:`AbsorptionCorrection <algm-AbsorptionCorrection>` where you may now get slightly different values.
- Added the ability to specify the packing fraction and effective number density to :ref:`SetSample <algm-SetSample>` and :ref:`SetSampleMaterial <algm-SetSampleMaterial>`.
- :ref:`CropWorkspaceRagged <algm-CropWorkspaceRagged>` now produces ragged workspace and can now be used on large data sets.
- Added the ability to specify a ``CustomGroupingString`` when creating a detector grouping workspace using :ref:`CreateGroupingWorkspace <algm-CreateGroupingWorkspace>`.
- :ref:`LoadLamp <algm-LoadLamp>` is corrected to load sample logs as well under python3.
- Added the ability to specify the spectrum number in :ref:`FindPeaksAutomatic <algm-FindPeaksAutomatic>`.

Fitting
-------

- Corrected a bug in the calculation of uncertainty bands on the calculated fit curve. This correction has been tested against the python fitting package `kmpfit`, where an agreement between the two was seen.

See :doc:`mantidworkbench`.

SliceViewer and Vates Simple Interface

Improvements
############
- Member function: MDGeometry::getNumNonIntegratedDims() returns the number of non-integrated dimensions present.

Bugfixes
########
- Error log messages from an EqualBinChecker are now no longer produced when editing python scripts if a workspace is present with unequal bin sizes
- Warning log messages from the InstrumentValidator are no longer produced when editing some python scripts.
- A bug has been fixed when plotting bin plots on a workspace with numerical axis.
- A bug is fixed when setting the same axis to multiple workspaces, which would cause a crash when deleting the workspaces.
- Give warning when instrument in Facilities.xml has errors
